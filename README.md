## Project Overview

This project is an interactive Excel dashboard designed to analyze the Nigerian car market.  
It visualizes key vehicle metrics, popular car brands, buyer preferences, and regional distribution to provide clear market insights.

## Data Source

The dataset is a Cars45‑scraped dataset from Nigeria, shared publicly in a YouTube tutorial for educational purposes.
Fields include make, model, year, price, mileage, color, and transmission.

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts, Slicers for interactive filtering, Formulas for calculations and insights, Data cleaning and formatting, Map visualizations)

## Data Cleaning / Preparation

The dataset was cleaned and prepared for analysis by:
- Removing duplicates and irrelevant columns
- Splitting combined fields into separate columns (make, model, year, color)
- Converting numeric fields (price, mileage) and standardizing categorical values
- Filling missing values and ensuring consistency across regions

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The following questions were explored in the dataset:
- What are the average vehicle metrics (price, mileage, horsepower, and engine size)?
- Which are the top 10 most popular car models in Nigeria?
- What is the drivers’ preferred transmission type: Automatic or Manual?
- Which car colors are most popular (top 10)?
- Which locations (states or cities) have higher car purchases?

## Dashboard Features

- KPI cards showing average price, mileage, horsepower, and engine size
- Interactive slicers for Brand New, Foreign Used, and Nigerian Used cars
- Visualization of top 10 most popular car brands and models
- Donut chart for transmission preferences (Automatic vs Manual)
- Car color preference analysis
- Geographic distribution of cars across Nigeria
- Clean, dark-themed, and user-friendly design with a car image background to reflect the Nigerian car market
  
## Analysis Results

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
- The average vehicle metrics show that the price is 5M, mileage is 28K km, horsepower is 217 hp, and engine size is 3K cc.
- The top car brands sold in the Nigerian car market are Toyota, Honda, Lexus, and Mercedes Benz. Most drivers prefer automatic transmission cars.
- The most popular car colors are black, grey, and silver.
- Lagos and Abuja have higher car purchases compared to other regions.
  
## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following
- Car dealerships and sellers should focus on stocking popular brands like Toyota, Honda, Lexus, and Mercedes Benz
- Automatic transmission cars should be prioritized since they are preferred by most drivers
- Offering vehicles in neutral colors such as black, grey, and silver could attract more buyers
- Marketing efforts can be concentrated in Lagos and Abuja, where car purchases are highest
- Monitoring average vehicle metrics like price, mileage, horsepower, and engine size can help set competitive prices and meet buyer expectations
## Limitations

- The dataset is scraped from Cars45 and may not reflect the most recent market data
- Some entries had missing or inconsistent values, which could affect analysis accuracy
- Only basic vehicle metrics and trends are analyzed; advanced statistical or predictive analysis was not performed
